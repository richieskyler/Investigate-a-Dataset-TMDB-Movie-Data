### INVESTIGATE A DATASET

#### Project Overview

In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You willo use the Python libraries <b>Numpy</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, and <b>Matplotlib</b> to make your analysis easier.

You can prepare for this project with: <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170-nd">Intro to Data Analysis</a>

#### Why do i need to install? 

You will need an installation of Python software: ANACONDA for high end system which comes with most common libraries for data analysis and MINICONDA for system for with low configuration which requires libraries like Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib and CSV to be installed fo analysis
 
#### Why this Project?

 In this project, you will go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.

 You'll use Python libraries <b>Numpy</b>, <b>Pandas</b>, and <b>Matplotlib</b>, ehich mkaes writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier. 

#### What will you learn?

 After completing the project, you will:

 - Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
 - Be comfortable posng questions that can be answered with a given dataset and the answering those questions
 - Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
 - Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
 - Be able to use vectorized operations in <b>Numpy</b> and <b>Pandas</b> to speed up your data analysis code
 -  Be familiar with pandaSeries and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
 - Know how to use <b>Matplotlib</b> tp produce plota showing your findings

#### Introduction

 For this project, we will conduct a data analysis and create a file to share and documents your findings. We start by taking a look at the dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then we use <b>Pandas</b> and <b>Numpy</b> to answer the questions we are interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. 

 For this project i used the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.I would like to find other intresting patterns in the dataset.
